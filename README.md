# assignment3
This file is for solving my Machine Learning assignment3.
I will mainly applying R to solve the tasks. However, at certain points, I might switch to Python, let's see. 
There will be two files( or maybe more, I will slowly update), one for R code which including all the in-house function. And the other one is my answers for tasks in PDF format. 
Anyway, enjoy!
